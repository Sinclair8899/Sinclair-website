農曆馬年除夕之際，回望2025，全球AI與半導體產業已從「算力競賽」走向「能源、製造與實體世界整合」的新階段。未來一年，AI價值將不再只屬於模型與軟體，而更深刻地體現在電力供應、先進製程、材料創新與產業落地能力之中。誰能掌握硬體基礎與跨域應用，誰就能在新一輪產業重組中取得長期優勢。As we welcome the Lunar New Year of the Horse, looking back at 2025, the global AI and semiconductor industries have begun shifting from a pure “compute race” toward a new phase defined by energy, manufacturing, and real-world integration. In the coming year, AI value will no longer reside mainly in models and software, but increasingly in power infrastructure, advanced fabrication, material innovation, and the ability to deploy intelligence at industrial scale. Those who control the physical foundations and cross-domain capabilities will hold the true long-term advantage.對我而言，2026不只是技術變革之年，更是持續學習、深化洞察與自我成長的一年。願在快速變動的時代中，保持理性、好奇與韌性，與世界同步前行。For me, 2026 is not only a year of technological transformation, but also one of continuous learning, deeper insight, and personal growth. In a rapidly changing world, may we all maintain clarity, curiosity, and resilience as we move forward together.值此除夕，祝福大家新年平安健康、心境安定、智慧增長，在不確定中依然看見希望與方向。On this Lunar New Year’s Eve, I wish everyone peace, good health, steady hearts, and growing wisdom — and the ability to see hope and direction even amid uncertainty.

### Research Square Preprints

#### Multi-Target Gene Therapy for Osteoarthritis: A Computational and Structural Analysis Framework

*Huang, Po-Sung (Sinclair)* (2026)
DOI: [10.21203/rs.3.rs-8774255/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-8774255/v1)
*Posted: February 3, 2026*

**Background:** Osteoarthritis (OA) remains therapeutically intractable despite advances in regenerative medicine. Single-target interventions consistently yield transient symptomatic relief without durable structural modification.

This work presents a computational and structural analysis framework for multi-target gene therapy approaches in osteoarthritis treatment. Licensed under CC BY 4.0.

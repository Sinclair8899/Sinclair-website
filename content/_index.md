# Independent Researcher in AI-Driven Industrial Competitiveness

Welcome to my research platform exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, industrial strategy, and emerging technologies.

## Research Focus

My work centers on understanding how AI is reshaping competitive dynamics across **semiconductors, advanced materials, and AI-enabled biological systems research**. Through quantitative analysis and industry insights, I examine the strategic implications of AI-driven transformation for businesses and industries.

### Core Research Areas

**AI & Semiconductor Valuation**  
Developing frameworks for analyzing competitive positioning and market dynamics of AI chip companies in an era of rapid technological change.

**Industrial Strategy**  
Examining how artificial intelligence is transforming traditional manufacturing sectors and creating new paradigms for competitive advantage.

**Biotech & AI Integration**  
Exploring AI-enabled biological systems modeling and life-science research applications in industrial contexts (non-clinical, non-medical).

**Materials Innovation**  
Analyzing innovation pathways and strategic positioning in specialty chemicals and advanced materials industries.
